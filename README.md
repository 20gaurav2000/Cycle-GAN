# Cycle-GAN
CycleGAN uses a cycle consistency loss to enable training without the need for paired data. In other words, it can translate from one domain to another without a one-to-one mapping between the source and target domain.  This opens up the possibility to do a lot of interesting tasks like photo-enhancement, image colorization, style transfer, etc. All you need is the source and the target dataset (which is simply a directory of images).
